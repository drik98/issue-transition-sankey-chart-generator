# Issue Transition Sankey Chart Generator

The goal of this web application is to visualize how the status of the
issues has changed from the start to the end of a sprint.

The application is automatically deployed via netlify once changes have been pushed to the `main` branch.
It is available at [issue-transitions-sankey.netlify.app](https://issue-transitions-sankey.netlify.app) as well
